### phanpy.linuxusers.in

Iâ€™ve self-hosted **[Phanpy](https://github.com/cheeaun/phanpy)** at **phanpy.linuxusers.in** after it was unavailable this morning. I host a **Snac** instance (similar to Mastodon) on **[linuxusers.in](https://linuxusers.in)**, and some of my friends use Phanpy as a frontend client. This prompted me to ensure a reliable access point for everyone. You can now access it anytime at **[phanpy.linuxusers.in](https://phanpy.linuxusers.in)**.
